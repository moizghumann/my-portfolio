{/* Importing Modules:
It's like bringing some helpful friends who know how to handle papers and organize them.

Setting the Folder Location:
You tell your friends the exact spot where the folder is kept, so they know where to look for the papers.

Getting Ready to Organize:
You and your friends get ready to start organizing the papers.

Reading the Paper Names:
You and your friends start looking at each paper in the folder and noting down their names.

Collecting Information from the Papers:
You and your friends read the special information written on each paper, like dates and other important details.

    Extracting the paper's ID:
    Imagine removing the paper's label (".md") to get a clean ID.

    Determining the paper's location:
    Think of it as knowing where the paper is stored in the filing cabinet.    

    Reading the paper's contents:
    Just like opening the paper and reading what's written inside.

    Parsing the paper's special information:
    It's like going through the paper and picking out the important details.

        Combining all the information about the paper

Sorting the Papers by Date:
You and your friends put the papers in order based on their dates. The newest paper comes first, followed by the older ones.

Returning the Organized Papers:
You and your friends give back the papers, but this time they are arranged nicely based on their dates. Now you can easily find the papers you need.

That's how the code works! It helps you organize papers (markdown files) by their dates (metadata) so that you can find them easily when needed. */}
